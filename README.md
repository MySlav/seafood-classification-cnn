# Seafood classification

Final project of course "Advanced Machine Learning Methods".


## Description

I have chosen to deal with image classification and tried to solve this problem of Seafood images classification utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I utilized transfer learning method, I loaded some of the pretrained models like “DenseNet”, “MobileNetV2” and “ResNet” and changed the final layer. The parameters for the rest of the network were left frozen.
